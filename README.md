# What is this?
Sometimes I have some e-books to read, which are in plain text format, such as `.txt`. But I prefer to read books in epub format.
So I write this project, it can convert a `.txt` file to a `.epub` file.

## Reference
+ A epub template: refer to [epub-boilerplate](https://github.com/javierarce/epub-boilerplate.git)
